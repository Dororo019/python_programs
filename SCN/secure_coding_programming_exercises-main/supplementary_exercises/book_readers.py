# of books from Project Gutenberg:
# 1. war_and_peace.txt
# 2. pride_and_prejudice.txt
# 3. crime_and_punishment.txt

# 1) Open `war_and_peace.txt`, read the whole file content and store it in a variable
# 2) Open `crime_and_punishment.txt` and overwrite the whole content with the last two words of the text of `war_and_peace.txt`
# 3) Loop over all three files and print out only the first word of each.
