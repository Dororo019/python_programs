# Exercise

# Write a program by accepting 2 numbers from the user and check number is greater than other and print the result
# you can use the function `input()` to get user input

# example
first_number = input("please enter a number: ")
second_number = input("please enter another number!: ")

print(first_number)
print(first_number,type(first_number))

print(second_number,type(second_number))

## note, what type is your first_number? float & int Is it what you expected? yes but it gave str
## look-up the input() documentation to find out what type it will create by default?? by default it returns a str type
