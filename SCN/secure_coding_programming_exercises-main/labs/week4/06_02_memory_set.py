# MEMORY GAME WITH SETS
# Continuously collect number input from a user with a `while` loop.
# Confirm that the input can be converted to an integer,
# then add it to a Python `set()`.
# If the element was already in the set, notify the user that their
# their input is a duplicate and deduct a point.
# If the user loses 5 points, quit the program.
# They win if they manage to create a set that has more than 10 items.

# you will need the `input()` function to collect information from the user
