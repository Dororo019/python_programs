You may want to do this exercise interactively with an interpreter session

Path.cwd() gets the current working directory, returns a Path object
os.chdir(path)  changes directory	

os.listdir() files and directories, returns a list
Path.glob(“*”)  returns a generator that you can use to iterate over all files and directories. Advantage is you can filter the results easily on the input.
